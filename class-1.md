Class 1

The phases, or steps, of successful project management are (spoilers) initiation, planning, execution, control, and closure. In this lesson, we dive into what that means.

Project management fits neatly into 5 Phases.

Initiation - Pre-planning phase conceptual phase: Should we do this? Can we do this? Is it possible?

Planning - Putting together the logistics of actually carrying out a feasible project.

Execution - The "doing" part of doing a project.

Control - Also known as monitoring, in this part you as a PM make sure everything goes according to your cunning plan.

Closure - Exactly what it sounds like and exactly as necessary as you think.
